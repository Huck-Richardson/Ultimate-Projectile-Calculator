If your going to use Scientist mode you really need to know what you're theoreticaly throwing, and
the air density (kg/m), the aceleration due to gravity (m/s) and power output per kilogram. For normal you
also need to know what you're throwing but not the more complex stuff. For Orc mode you all need is your 
height and weight. You'll need to know all of this in SI units . If you want to throw things on other 
planets consult the handy infomation below.


If you want to see how far you can throw something on another planet see below.
Mars: Acceleration due to Gravity = 3.7 mps | Atmospheric density = 0.02 kg/m
Venus: Acceleration due to Gravity = 8.87 mps | Atmospheric density = 67 kg/m
Jupiter (troposphere): Acceleration due to Gravity = 24.5 mps | Atmospheric density = 101971.6 kg/m
Dagobah: Acceleration due to Gravity = 8.83 mps | Atmospheric density = 1.225 kg/m

Helpful infomation for Scientist Mode
Average Air Density at Sea Level = 1.225 kg/m
Average Aceleration due to Gravity = 9.8 m/s
Weight of a Baseball = 0.14 kilograms
Cross Sectional Area of a Baseball = 0.01 meters
1 kg = 2.2 lb, 1 m = 3.28 feet, m/2 = 2.24
Power Ouput per kilogram = 10 for normal person, 20 for pro althlete
